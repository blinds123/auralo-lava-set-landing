# EXPECTED CONVERSION IMPROVEMENT

Current estimated conversion: 2-3%
After Phase 1: 4-5%
After Phase 2: 6-7%
After Phase 3: 8-10%

Target for luxury fashion: 8-12%

# KEY INSIGHT

The biggest conversion killer is the trust gap between the luxury positioning and the low price. This needs a dedicated section explaining WHY it's $29 (excess inventory, direct-to-consumer, special promotion, etc.) to overcome the "too good to be true" objection that 76% of personas mentioned.
